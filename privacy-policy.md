**Last Updated: February 2, 2026**

Beaver ("the App") is a personal net worth tracking app built with a privacy-first architecture. This policy explains how we handle your data to ensure transparency and security.

## 1. Data We Collect

### Financial Information (User-Provided)
Beaver allows you to track account names, balances, and check-in history. This data is provided exclusively by you. 
* **Encryption:** All financial sensitive fields are **fully encrypted** on your device using industry-standard AES-256-GCM encryption before being stored or synced.
* **Access:** We do not have the keys to your data; we cannot see, access, or sell your financial information.

### Functional Diagnostics & Analytics
To improve the customer journey and identify where users may get stuck, we collect **anonymous, de-identified usage data**.
* **What we track:** Feature usage (e.g., which tabs are visited, frequency of currency picker use) and app performance metrics.
* **Privacy Guarantee:** This data contains no financial values, account names, or personal identifiers. It is used solely to improve the App's navigation and functionality.

### Feedback
If you use the in-app feedback tool, your message is stored in a CloudKit public database. This information is only used to respond to your requests.

## 2. How Your Data Is Stored & Shared

### iCloud & CloudKit
Your data is stored locally on your device and optionally synced via your private Apple iCloud container. This storage is governed by [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

### Partner Sharing
If you utilize the collaboration feature, selected data is shared only with the specific individuals you explicitly invite via a secure iOS CloudKit Share. You remain in control of who has access at all times.

### Encryption Keys
Your encryption keys are generated on-device and stored securely in your private **iCloud Keychain**. This ensures that even if someone accessed your database, the content would remain unreadable.

## 3. Data We Do NOT Collect
* We do **not** sell, trade, or rent your personal or financial data to third parties.
* We do **not** use third-party advertising SDKs or tracking "pixels."
* We do **not** have access to your bank accounts or login credentials.

---

## 4. Your Rights & Choices
* **Data Deletion:** You can delete all local and cloud-synced data at any time via **Settings > Data Management > Delete All Data**.
