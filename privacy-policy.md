# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 30, 2026

Beaver ("the App") is a personal net worth tracking app developed by Kuba Bajda. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected.

## Data We Collect

The App stores the following data that you provide:

- **Account information:** Account names, types, categories, currencies, and balances
- **Check-in data:** Monthly snapshots of your account balances
- **App preferences:** Your selected currency, net worth goal, and display settings

## How Your Data Is Stored

- All data is stored **on your device** and optionally synced via **Apple iCloud (CloudKit)**.
- If you enable iCloud, your data is stored in your private iCloud container and governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).
- If you use the partner sharing feature, selected data is shared via iCloud with the person you explicitly invite.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect analytics or usage data.
- We do **not** use third-party tracking, advertising, or analytics SDKs.
- We do **not** sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties.
- We do **not** have access to your financial data — it never leaves your device or your iCloud account.

## Feedback

If you use the in-app feedback feature, your message is stored in a CloudKit public database associated with the App. No personally identifiable information is attached to feedback submissions beyond what iCloud provides internally.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all your data at any time from **Settings > Data Management > Delete All Data** within the App. This removes all local and iCloud-synced data.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.
